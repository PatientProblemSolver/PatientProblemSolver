# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Computer Science in Denmark and have a keen interest in all areas of software development. I aim to create code that's not just functional, but also well-structured and reliable. I enjoy tackling complex problems and value the ongoing learning this field offers.

I believe in the power of teamwork and clear communication to achieve collective goals. I'm eager to support projects that have a positive impact, and I look forward to contributing my share to a dynamic team.
